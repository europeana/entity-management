1. Saving the zoho organization response for the integration tests.
In the method Optional<Entity> eu.europeana.entitymanagement.zoho.organization.ZohoDereferenceService.dereferenceEntityById(@NonNull String id) throws Exception,
add the following code:

HashMap<String, Object> keyValues = zohoOrganization.get().getKeyValues();
System.out.println(objectMapper.writeValueAsString(keyValues));

The objectMapper used across the entire application can be injected into the constructor:

private ObjectMapper objectMapper;  
public ZohoDereferenceService(ZohoAccessConfiguration zohoAccessConfiguration,
      @Qualifier(AppConfigConstants.BEAN_JSON_MAPPER) ObjectMapper objectMapper) {
    this.zohoAccessConfiguration = zohoAccessConfiguration;
    this.objectMapper = objectMapper;
}

The printed response can then be saved to a file in test/resources. Also make sure to adjust the fields to be either string or list type (no map).

2. Whenever introducing new custom types for a field for any of the model definition classes, e.g. Organization, make sure to properly hanlde the merging of the entities in the method combineEntities(). 
Please also override the equals() method for the new field type and add it to the EntityFieldsTypes class.
